# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise identify how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Data
I performed an analysis in order to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch date. My analysis consisted of using the Kickstarter dataset to create a pivot table and a line graph that displays the relationship between successful, failed, and canceled theatre campaigns and their launch month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I performed an analysis in order to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on their funding goal amount using the Kickstarter dataset. My analysis consisted of creating a line graph that displays the relationship between the goal-amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge I faced was writing this report. I was unsure about how technical my analysis should be and whether I should include every single step I took to perform my analysis or not. I eventually decided to omit that part of my analysis to avoid redundance. Another difficulty I encountered was arranging the dollar amount ranges in the correct order on my "Outcomes Based on Goals" line graph. I tried sorting the columns in the pivot table and changing the formats but it just put them in alphabetical order so I arranged them manually. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions I can draw about the outcomes based on launch date are that the month that launches the most successful theatre campaigns is May and there is an increase in successful theatre campaigns between March and May that steadily falls through year end.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude that the relationship between the outcomes based on goals are inversely correlated. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this dataset are possible sampling and coverage errors. Additional limitations include measure used to collect the data, and access. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a stacked column chart to visualize outcomes based on goals. Another chart we could create is a pie chart to visualize theatre outcomes based on launch date.
